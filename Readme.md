# STATS SUBGROUP PLOTS
## Graphically compare the distributions of a set of variables across a partition of the data
 This procedure produces a set of small plots for specified variables for each subgroup in a dataset. Each plot shows the distribution of a variable in that subgroup overlaid on the distribution of the entire dataset.  The type of plot depends on the measurement level of the variable.
