  <h1>Plot Variables for Subgroups Against the Entire
  Sample</h1>This procedure produces small charts for selected
  variables across subgroups of the data. Each chart displays the
  distribution for the entire sample with the distribution for the
  subgroup overlaid on it. This may be particularly useful for
  understanding clustering results, but any categorical variable
  can be used to define the groups.

  <p><span class="runinhead">Subgroups Defined by</span> Select a
  variable to define the subgroups to be plotted. Charts will be
  generated for each distinct value of the variable.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Variables to Plot</span> Select the
  variables whose distribution will be plotted. For categorical
  variables, bar charts are produced; for scale variables, the
  charts are histograms. If the number of variables exceeds the row
  size limit (see the Options subdialog), each set of charts will
  take multiple rows.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• Graphs do not include tick marks or labels
  due to space constraints. For scale variables, the axis range is
  from the data minimum to the data maximum for the entire dataset.
  For categorical variables, all labelled values and any other
  values found in the subgroup are included.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Cases are sorted by the subgroup
  variable</span> Check this box if the data are already sorted by
  the subgroup variable in order to save an extra sorting step.</p>

  <h2>Options</h2>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Individual Chart Size</span> Enter the
  horizontal and vertical dimensions of the chart in inches. This
  size refers to the individual charts; not the overall size of the
  display. If the horizontal size is two inches, and there are five
  variables, the set of charts for each subgroup would be ten
  inches wide.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Vertical Chart Scaling
  Percentage</span> Enter a percentage to shrink the chart data
  area by in the vertical dimension. The default value, 90, need
  only be changed if the horizontal axis labels are clipped, which
  can happen with very small charts.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Charts Per Row</span> By default, all
  the charts for a subgroup are displayed in one row (up to ten).
  Specify the maximum number of charts to appear in one row.
  Additional rows of charts for each subgroup are displayed as
  needed.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Transparency Percentage</span> Each
  chart shows the distribution of the variable for the subgroup
  overlaid on the distribution in the entire dataset. The
  transparency percentage controls how the entire distribution
  shows through the subgroup distribution. 0 means no transparency,
  and 100 means complete transparency.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Histogram Shape</span> Choose Area to
  display the histograms as areas and Bars to display them with
  bars. Choose Kernel Smoother to display a smoothed density
  function.</p>

  <p class="bullet">• With Kernel Smoother, the entire-group and
  subgroup distributions are each scaled to the number of points in
  them. For the others, the two charts are on the same scale.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Proportion for Kernel Smoother</span>
  specifies the proportion of points that are used in calculating
  the density function estimate.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Missing Values</span> Choose the
  missing value treatment. If <span class="screen">By
  variable</span>, each graph uses all the data available on the
  variable. If <span class="screen">Listwise</span>, only the cases
  where none of the graphed variables is missing are used in each
  graph. By variable maximizes the data in each graph; Listwise
  ensures a consistent case base across graphs.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Outline Label</span> Enter text to be
  used to label each set of graphs in the Viewer outline. The
  subgroup identification is appended to this text.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Temporary Directory</span> A temporary
  directory can be selected for the intermediate data file created
  by this procedure. This value only needs to be set if the
  procedure cannot otherwise find a temporary directory. For
  technical reasons, this procecdure cannot delete the file that it
  writes to this directory. Specifying a specific directory would
  make it easier to find and delete such files.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Colors</span> Select colors for the
  entire-dataset bars and the subgroup bars. A selection of colors
  is listed here, but many more are available in syntax. See the
  main help under GPL Color Constants for a complete list.</p>

  <p><span class="runinhead">Patterns</span> Select patterns for
  the entire-dataset and subgroup bars. By default, bars are
  solid.</p>

  <h2>Additional Features</h2>

  <p>This dialog generates syntax for the STATS SUBGROUP PLOTS
  extension command. To display syntax help for this command, run
  the following syntax:</p>

  <p class="codeblock">STATS SUBGROUP PLOTS /HELP.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>This command requires the Python Essentials
  and the STATS SUBGROUP PLOTS extension command and at least
  version 18 of IBM SPSS Statistics. You can download these from
  the SPSS Community website at
  www.ibm.com/developerworks/spssdevcentral.<br>
